# A collection of Python programming tasks

The repository contains more interesting tasks that I had to solve during various trainings / courses.

**Each *.py file contains one task.**<br>  
The task consists of:
- description
- solution to the task 
- simple test (pytest framework) to check that everything is working correctly.:wink:
